The severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
is a highly pathogenic human zoonotic
[coronavirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus), which causes
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In an effort to understand the host
transcriptional response to the SARS-Cov-2 virus, @blancomelo20 sequenced the
transcriptome of two different human cell lines, human alveolar adenocarcinoma
cells (A549) and primary human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells, after
infecting them with SARS-Cov-2, seasonal influenza A virus (IAV) and human
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and growing them in the same culture
conditions without infection (mock).

The resulting raw RNA-seq data have been deposited at the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO), where they are publicly available under accession
[GSE147507](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE147507).
Here, we show a first exploratory analysis of the corresponding RNA-seq gene
expression profiles generated as a table of counts using the DEE2
(https://dee2.io) pipeline by @ziemann19, and further packaged into a
[SummarizedExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/SummarizedExperiment)
object with genes mapped to Entrez identifiers. This object also stores
the phenotypic information about the profiled samples that has been also
made available at GEO.

The directories in this package template follow the structure of an R package
(consult this [link](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz) for further information) adapted
for the purpose of data analysis:

  * R: functions to avoid repeating steps and store auxiliary code,
  used in the vignette.

  * vignettes: Rmarkdown document of the data analysis.

  * inst/extdata: repository of the data to be analyzed and any other
  kind of additional functional and annotation data employed during
  the analysis and which is unavailable through an R package. This
  directory is moved to the package root directory at install.

  * inst/doc: repository for the results of the analysis that we
  want to provide without having to run the entire analysis again, e.g.,
  tables of differentially expressed genes. This directory is moved
  to the package root directory at install, where also the vignettes
  are installed.

  * man: manual pages of functions defined in the R directory that
  for some reason we want to export from the package.

Every other directory you see in this package has been automatically
generated in the package building process as, for instance, the `doc`
directory with the result of the vignette.

When you edit and adapt this vignette for your own data analysis project,
you should do it in the `.Rmd` file of the `vignettes` directory
(**not** the one copied to the `doc` directory because this one is overwritten
during package building and if you edit there **you will loose your edits**).
To build this vignette without building the entire package, you should type
the following in the R shell:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::build_vignettes()
```

This function call will build your vignette and copy the resulting HTML to
the `doc` directory. Thus, to see the result, you should go there and open
that HTML file.

The rest of the documentation of this package is provided within the files
of the R directory using
[roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html),
which means that before you build the entire package you have to generate the
documentation and `NAMESPACE` file typing in the R shell:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::document()
```

Both steps, calling `devtools::build_vignettes()` and `devtools::document()`
have to be done from the root directory of your package.

**IMPORTANT**: This package template is just an example to facilitate getting
started with R-markdown, illustrate the encapsulation of a data analysis into
an R package and provide an example of a possible structure of the data analysis
for the the project. You do *not* have to do the analysis of your dataset
exactly in the same way as it is done here. Please read carefully the
description of the project, and its technical requirements to know what you are
expected to do. In particular, when you carry out the second part of the
project, you should conduct the differential expression analysis in the way that
best suits the questions you want to address. You do not need to do the analysis
in every possible way, just in one way, in the way you think it makes more sense
to you.

IF YOU THINK AN ANALYSIS OR A DIAGNOSTIC OR A VISUALIZATION
DOES NOT MAKE SENSE, OR IT IS NOT JUSTIFIED, **YOU SHOULD NOT DO IT**.
